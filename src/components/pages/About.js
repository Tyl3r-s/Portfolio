            Technology has always been a huge fascination of mine, and jumping into code
            is one of the best decisions I've made in life. I have found a passion for creating succinct and intuitive user
            experiences, and I take pride in building efficient and organized back-end infrastructure. I truly love the
            endless discovery and learning that you find in the programming world.
